# This migration reverts the mistaken timestamp reinterpretation done in 0014.
# Context: 0014 attempted to "fix" legacy timestamps before a cutoff, but this was only
# a local environment issue and should not have been applied in production. We now
# reverse the effect for rows before the same cutoff wall time.

# Define model fields to adjust (app_label, ModelName, field_name) â€” mirror 0014
