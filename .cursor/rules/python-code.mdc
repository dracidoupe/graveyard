# Multilingual Codebase
- Observe basic language divison:
    - All user-facing output is in Czech (messages etc.)
    - All non-user facing code is in English
    - Translation table is managed in [dictionary.rst](mdc:docs/dictionary.rst); observe it and update it only if necessary

# Basic Python and Django Code Rules

- Write idiomatic Python code
- Write pythonic code
- When generating URLs, always use path names from [urls.py](mdc:ddcz/urls.py). Note that in the project, that is mounted with a "ddcz:" prefix that always have to be used
- All models usable in the application is available in [__init__.py](mdc:ddcz/models/used/__init__.py), but is always imported in [__init__.py](mdc:ddcz/models/__init__.py); always import them directly from ddcz.models
- Code uses older Python and Django; always verify suggestions are compatible with versions specified in [runtime.txt](mdc:runtime.txt) and [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt)
- Always try to minimize the amount of dependencies

# Testing

- Always use Django testing framework
- For all changes, always capture their intent in unittests
